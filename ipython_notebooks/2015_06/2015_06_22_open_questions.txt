The following questions are outstanding:

* How many samples per group are required from each group to properly sample the space?

* How do the number of samples required per group change when additional constraints are placed on the data?

* How many simulations are required to properly sample the space? Is it better to have a more exactly power estimation, or to have more simulations?

* How many points are required for an accurate power estimate?

* How many metadata categories need to be controlled for a better estimate? Does the effect size of these categories matter?
